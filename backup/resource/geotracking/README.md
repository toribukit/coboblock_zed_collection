# Geotracking

These samples show how to use the ZED SDK Geotracking module for **global scale localization on a real-world map**.

## Overview

The samples provided using the Geotracking API are organized as follows:

- [Live Geotracking](./live%20geotracking/) The Live Geotracking sample demonstrates how to use the Geotracking API using both the ZED camera and an external GNSS sensor. It displays the corrected positional tracking in the ZED reference frame on an OpenGL window and the geo-position on a real-world map in ZEDHub.

- [Geotracking Data Recording](./recording/): The Recording sample demonstrates how to **record data** from both a ZED camera and an external GNSS sensor. The recorded data is saved in an SVO file and a JSON file, respectively. This sample provides the necessary data to be used by the Playback sample. 

- [Geotracking Data Playback](./playback/): The Playback sample shows how to use the geotracking API for global scale localization on a real-world map. It takes the data generated by the Recording sample and uses it to display geo-positions on a real-world map.
