# Deploy a ZED Hub app as a service

For production, you need to deploy your application on your device as a service, using Docker.
Here is the full explanation of how to do it. Examples are available on [**ZED Hub Samples**](./samples/README.md).

## General structure
A ZED Hub app runs in a Docker container. The [ZED Hub documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/cloud/applications/) explains in detail how an app is structured and deployed.
To deploy an app you need to upload a .zip file that contains at least:
- a `docker-compose.yml` describing how the application should be run
- a runtime `Dockerfile` listing the steps and commands to compile and run the application.
- an `app.json` file that describes your application, specifies its name and release name and defines application parameters (see [tutorial_04_application_parameters](./tutorials/tutorial_04_application_parameters/README.md) for more information about it)
- the source code or the executable

> **Note**: You can generate the correct file structure with
```bash
$ edge_cli create_app PATH [c++|python]
```

We provide tutorials and samples to develop your app in C++ and Python. The samples are specially made to describe how to deploy an app as a service.

### Developing an app in C++

With C++, your app should fit with this design :

```bash
.
├── app
│   └── Dockerfile
├── app.json
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
└── sources
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── src
        └── main.cpp
```
The `Dockerfile` in the `sources` directory is dedicated to run your app. 
- If you want it to build on the device, you should put a build step in the `Dockerfile` and provide the sources. This is the easiest way to deploy an application.

- If you don't want to build the app on every device, build it yourself and `COPY` the executable in the image. It can be harder to build an executable for Jetsons from an x86 host. You can use the docker image we provide for that.

### Developing an app in Python
With Python, your app should fit with this design :

```bash
.
├── app
│   └── Dockerfile
│   └── main.py
│   └── ...other sources files...
├── app.json
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md

```
Python does not need any build stage.

### Deploy stage
The deployment stage consists in creating a .zip file containing
- `app/Dockerfile`
- `app/<your_app> `the binaries generated during the **build stage**, or the source in case you are using Python.
- app.json
- `docker-compose.yml`
- an `icon.png` image (optional)

There is an automated command to do that :
```bash
$ cd /your/app/folder
$ edge_cli deploy .
```
`app.zip` file is generated. It is ready to be deployed.

Now you just need to deploy your app using the ZED Hub interface:
- In your workspace, in the **Applications** section, click on **Add application**
- Get the .zip and Drag’n’Drop in the dedicated area
- Select the devices on which you want to deploy the app and press **Upload**


## Docker complement
This section describes in more detail the different Docker related files used by the ZED Hub.

> **Note** : You will need a bit of experience with docker. As long as you know and understand the basics of building and running a container you'll be more than fine.

### docker-compose.yml
The **docker-compose.yml** file is the first file that is read when the "app" app is deployed. It mainly indicates the path to the runtime `Dockerfile` that indicates how the app must be run. It also configures the Docker environment.
```yml
version: '2.3'
services:
  tuto01_service:
    build :
        context : ./app
        dockerfile : Dockerfile
        args :
            BASE_IMAGE: stereolabs/iot:0.72.1-build-jetson-l4t35.1
    runtime: nvidia
    privileged: true
    network_mode: "host"
    environment:
        - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all
```

In this example, the container of the application will run the **tuto01_service** service. This service will use the Dockerfile named **Dockerfile** in the `./app` folder. This Dockerfile will be read with the parameter **BASE_IMAGE** set to `stereolabs/iot:0.72.1-build-jetson-l4t35.1` by default.


### Runtime Dockerfile

The runtime Dockerfile is the file that describes what your **Docker image** or **app** must do when deployed. It indicates which script or executable must be run. In the example below, the binary `app_executable` is run.

```dockerfile
ARG BASE_IMAGE
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

#Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update -y && \
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y tzdata libpng-dev && \
     rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* &&  apt-get autoremove &&  apt-get clean

#Copy your binary
COPY app_executable /
CMD ["/app_executable"]

```
